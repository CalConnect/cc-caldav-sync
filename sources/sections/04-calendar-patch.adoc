== The "calendar-patch" Preference

The "calendar-patch" preference indicates that the client wishes for the server
to use calendar patch documents in the HTTP response rather than entire calendar
resources. The value of the "since" parameter, which `MUST` be the value of a
previously returned `DAV:sync-token` property, provides the "sync anchor" from
which the server should generate the patch documents.
