== Changes to `GET` requests

A client can signal to a server that it is willing and able to receive a calendar
patch document rather than an entire calendar resource by including a Prefer header
field with the "calendar-patch" preference in a `GET` request.

If a server receives a "calendar-patch" preference, recognizes the supplied
sync-token, and is able to create a patch document for the resource in a format
compatible with one of the media types supplied in the Accept <<RFC7230>> request
header field, the server `MAY` respond to the request with the patch document in lieu
of the entire resource.
